# Terraform vs Pulumi

Both are great Infrastructure as Code tools. Let's compare them.

## Terraform

**Pros:**
- Declarative HCL syntax
- Large ecosystem and providers
- Mature and battle-tested
- State management included

**Cons:**
- HCL learning curve
- Limited logic in configurations

## Pulumi

**Pros:**
- Use real programming languages (Python, Go, TypeScript)
- More flexibility and logic
- Better IDE support

**Cons:**
- Requires programming knowledge
- Smaller ecosystem

## My Recommendation

**Terraform** for teams that want simplicity and declarative infrastructure.

**Pulumi** for teams that need complex logic and prefer programming languages.

## Final Thoughts

Choose based on your team's skills and requirements.
